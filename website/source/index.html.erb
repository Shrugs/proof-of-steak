                        computed cryptographically, backed by
                        <b>TrueBit</b> and a

                        Any token holder is considered a member of the

                        <b>Cook</b> by submitting a
                        <b>Proof of Steak*</b>. This transaction then goes through a verification phase modeled after
                        <a href="https://truebit.io">TrueBit's Verification Game</a>.

                    <p>
                        During the verification phase, any token holder may become
                        <b>Grill Master</b> by challenging the validity of a Cook's Proof of Steak. If a challenge by a Grill
                        Master is made, the Grilling of the Cook (verification game) begins. If no challenge is made by the
                        end of the verification phase, the Proof of Steak is considered genuine and is then finalized, recorded
                        forever in the Steakchain.

                    <p>
                        If a challenge by a Grill Master is made, the Grilling of the Cook determines whether or not a Proof of Steak is valid. In
                        TrueBit's Verification Game, arbitrary computation must be iteratively validated, but because the
                        Steak Network is only concerned with verifying the validity of Proofs of Steak, we can simplify the
                        model considerably.

                    <p>
                        The Steak Network elects Backseat Grillers (witnesses), following Proof of Stake semantics, who then have the right to vouch
                        for the validity or invalidity of a Proof of Steak. After a witness timeout period, the votes are
                        tallied, and the winner is determined.

                    <p>
                        The Steak Network also implement's TrueBit's Forced Errors logic to incentivize proof challenges. In the case of a forced
                        error, the game mechanics are inverted: a Cook submits an invalid Proof of Steak and Grill Masters
                        are rewarded by a jackpot for successfully challenging the Cook. Because of the jackpot payouts, network
                        participants are financially incentivized to be on the watch for invalid Proofs of Steak.

            <p>
                $TEAK Holders are stake holders in the Steak Network and are granted membership. They have the ability to become Cook by
                submitting Proof of Steak transactions to the network, as well as the ability to become Grill Master and
                challenge Cook's Proofs of Steak.

                <span class="icon">‚è≥</span>Certifiably Rare
            </h4>
            <p>
                There is a fixed amount of $TEAK; the tokens you own are certifiably rare, since no more than 975,220,000,000 will ever be
                created.
            </p>

            <h4>
                <span class="icon">üî•</span>$TEAK Can Be Burned
            </h4>
            <p>
                Just like real life, if a Cook or Grill Master behaves badly, their $TEAK can be burned. The end result of the Verification
                Game results in the malicious party's $TEAK being burned. The Steak Network uses Byzantine Proof of Stake
                to solve the "Nothing at Stake" problem; when Backseat Grillers vouch for a Proof of Steak, they burn $TEAK
                in the Steakchains that do not include the Proof of Steak in question. This is implemented as a knife-based
                slashing system.
            </p>

            <h4>
                <span class="icon">üç≥</span>Become Cook
            </h4>
            <p>
                Any $TEAK Holder may become Cook by submitting a Proof of Steak and staking $TEAK on its validity. If a Cook behaves correctly,
                their Proof of Steak is validated and added to the Steakchain. If a Cook's Proof of Steak is challenged and
                the Cook is the loser of the Grilling of the Cook, their $TEAK is burned.
            </p>

            <h4>
                <span class="icon">üî®</span>Become Grill Master
            </h4>
            <p>
                Any $TEAK Holder may become Grill Master by challenging a Cook's Proof of Steak and staking $TEAK on its invalidity. If the
                Grill Master is the winner of the Verification Game under normal conditions, they receive a small payout,
                deducted from the Cook's $TEAK stake. If the Grill Master is the winner of the Verification Game under forced-error
                conditions, they receive a jackpot payout, deducted from the shared jackpot pool. If the Grill Master loses
                the Verification Game, their $TEAK is burned.
            </p>

            <h4>
                <span class="icon">üöó</span>Become a Backseat Griller
            </h4>
            <p>
                By staking large amounts of $TEAK, $TEAK Holders can join the Backseat Griller Crowd. When a Proof of Steak is challenged
                and the Verification Game begins, Backseat Grillers are randomly selected by the network (ala Proof of Stake).
                Backseat Grillers have the ability to vouch for the validity or invalidity of a Proof of Steak. Backseat
                Grillers that side with the minority have their $TEAK burned. Under forced-error conditions, Backseat Grillers
                that side with the majority receive a share of the jackpot payout.

                Yes, I did all of this for the joke "Proof of Steak"
            </p>
            <p>
                But it turns out you could probably use Proof of Steak (this registry-curation protocol) to secure any list where the membership
                proofs ("I belong in this list of things") can't be modeled cryptographically, primarily things that are
                crowd-opinion-based or aren't yet machine-verifiable. It's effectively a Token-Curated Registry protocol
                implementation, but with the addition of Forced errors to incentivise verifiers.
            </p>
            <p>
                It could be used to create a set of verifiably rare memes, for example, or decentrally curate high-quality datasets for machine
                learning or AI training, or even creating a decentralized MTurk. Proof of Steak could be applied in any case
                where a high-quality list of items is more valuable than the sum of its parts.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't plan on actually implementing the Steak Network, although it would be
                <strike>fun</strike> revolutionary. If enough

                <strike>send me</strike> donate enough money and really want to see a damn mobile app for sharing pictures of steak
                powered by Ethereum, I'll quit my job and build the damn thing.
