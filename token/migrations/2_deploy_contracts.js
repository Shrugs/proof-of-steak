/**
 * The Ethereum Foundation address is 0xfB6916095ca1df60bB79Ce92cE3Ea74c37c5d359
 *   but it requires a congres to execute arbitrary transactions, and
 *   requiring a congress for the 33 * 0.1 === 3.3 ETH
 *   that we're sending their way is a little unnecesary.
 *
 * So instead I'll be accepting the funds to a separate, personal address
 *   and then forwarding them onwards to the Ethereum Foundation. This also makes it
 *   possible for me to obtain a Unicorn token to an address I control
 *   (rather than the DontationSplitter contract obtaining the token and
 *    me needing to write custom logic to transfer it to an address I control).
 *
 * Anyway, I'm aware that this defeats the purpose of smart contracts by
 *   putting a human in the middle, but it's the most reasonable decision
 *   given the circumstances.
 *
 * And the only people who care are the people who might be reading this code (hi!)
 *
 * So for personal accountability, my name is Matt Condon, and you can find me on
 *   twtter at @mattgcondon and various websites around the web as @shrugs.
 *
 * I plan on having a long-lasting and valuable career in blockchain tech,
 *   so burning that on 3.3 ETH would be a little silly ðŸ˜œ
